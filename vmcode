    # $A, $C, and $V are reserved for specific instruction operations and should not be set manually.
    # The result of conditional operations is stored in $C for further branching logic.
    # $T contains 8 sub-registers (N0 to N7). Use the `setn` instruction to select the active sub-register.
    # $M represents memory, with its specific address determined by the value in $A.
    # $D, $L, and $P are available for general-purpose use.
    # Suggested usage:
        # $L for the local base address
        # $P for the stack top
        # in constructor or method, "@L 0" == "self"
